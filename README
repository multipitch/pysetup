pysetup

Contains a simple script to set up a new python project the way I like it.
This assumes pyenv, virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper are installed.
It also assumes the correct target python version is installed via pyenv.
It also assumes that the virtualenv and the destination folder don't already
exist.

Usage:
./pysetup PROJECT_NAME PYTHON_VERSION
e.g
./pysetup my_new_project 3.8.0
